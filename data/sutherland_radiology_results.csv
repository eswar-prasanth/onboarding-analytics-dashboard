The lesion on the ~lateral aspect of the midportion of the kidney has significant activity ~along its posterior border although the remainder of the lesion does not ~have significant uptake. Nonetheless, this appears to be the location of ~the previously biopsied oncocytoma.~~A second exophytic mass is seen at the lower pole of the left kidney, but ~this lesion has no significant uptake of the radiopharmaceutical.~~IMPRESSION: Only the previously biopsied lesion on the lateral aspect of ~the midportion of the right kidney has significant uptake of the ~radiopharmaceutical, consistent with the previously confirmed oncocytoma.~~On the basis of this study, none of the other lesions in either kidney ~can't be confirmed to be an oncocytoma. Given that the index lesion at ~the upper pole of the left kidney is considered a Bosniak class IV ~lesion, it is most likely to be a malignancy.~~--- End of Report ---~~~~~ ~~STEPHEN SCHARF MD; Attending Nuclear Medicine ~This document has been electronically signed.

Evaluation for metastases.~~Procedure: Following the intravenous administration of approximately 20 ~mCi of technetium 99m labeled MDP, images of the whole body were obtained ~in the anterior and posterior projections at about two hours.~~Findings:~Symmetric, physiologic radiotracer distribution throughout the axial and ~appendicular skeleton. No areas of focally increased or decreased ~radiotracer uptake to suggest osseous metastatic disease. Physiologic ~radiotracer activity noted in the bilateral kidneys and bladder.~~Impression:~No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastasis.~~--- End of Report ---~~~~~JOHN MAHON MD; Fellow Radiology~This document has been electronically signed.~AVRAHAM ZLOCHOWER MD; Attending Radiologist~This document has been electronically signed.
