    "reasoning": "The I70 series refers to atherosclerosis, which is a progressive vascular disease that can lead to complications such as ischemia and ulceration. This code indicates an advanced state of arterial disease that can have significant clinical implications for patient management.",
    "clinical_impact": "high",
    "radiology_relevance": "Radiologists must identify and report findings of atherosclerotic changes as these directly influence treatment decisions and risk stratification, particularly when associated with complications like ulceration.",

    "code": "R937",
    "classification": "unimportant",
    "category": "Symptom Codes (R series)",
    "reasoning": "ICD code R937 falls under the R series, which is generally used for abnormal clinical or imaging findings that are non-specific. These codes usually represent findings that do not point to a specific active disease process requiring immediate intervention.",
    "clinical_impact": "low",
    "radiology_relevance": "Although radiologists report these abnormal imaging findings, they are typically incidental and nonspecific, not altering immediate patient management in a critical manner.",

    "classification": "important",
    "category": "Cancer Codes",
    "reasoning": "This ICD code represents a malignant neoplasm of the breast, which is a cancer diagnosis. Cancer codes have high clinical significance as they directly affect prognosis, staging, and treatment decisions.",
    "clinical_impact": "high",
    "radiology_relevance": "Identifying and reporting a malignant breast neoplasm is critical in radiology, as it guides further diagnostic evaluation, treatment planning, and follow-up imaging for disease progression or metastasis.",
    "original_code": "C50212"
  },
  {
    "code": "Z905",
    "classification": "unimportant",
    "category": "History Codes",
    "reasoning": "Z905 is a history code, indicating prior health status or surgical outcome without direct implications on current imaging interpretation or immediate patient care. While it provides background information, it does not change the clinical management based on radiological findings.",
    "clinical_impact": "low",
    "radiology_relevance": "It is useful for obtaining a comprehensive patient history but does not affect the current radiological assessment or urgent clinical decision-making.",

  {
    "code": "N289",
    "classification": "unimportant",
    "category": "Minor Findings",
    "reasoning": "N289 (Disorder of kidney and ureter, unspecified) is a nonspecific code that does not indicate a clearly defined, acute, or progressive condition. It generally represents an incidental or vague finding that lacks the detailed diagnostic emphasis required for high clinical impact.",
    "clinical_impact": "low",
    "radiology_relevance": "This code is less likely to influence immediate radiological interpretations or decision-making, as it does not provide specific information regarding a significant pathology.",

    "code": "D3011",
    "classification": "unimportant",
    "category": "Minor Findings",
    "reasoning": "D3011 is a code for a benign neoplasm. The clinically significant cancer codes are reserved for malignant neoplasms (C codes), and benign neoplasms typically have less impact on immediate treatment or prognosis.",

    "radiology_relevance": "While radiologists should note the presence of benign lesions, these findings do not usually alter urgent patient management or require immediate intervention.",
