      "could_be_partial_match": true,
      "could_be_complete_match": false,
      "reasoning": "There is some commonality in capturing the preoperative evaluation (albeit with slight differences in the code extension), but the differences \u2013 namely the inappropriate use of a lung transplant status code by Sutherland and the additional, clinically relevant procedure code provided by AI \u2013 prevent this case from being classified as a complete match. Aligning the preoperative evaluation codes and including the diagnostic test would produce a partial match."
    },
    "overall_assessment": "In this No Match case, the AI coding approach is more accurate because it avoids misclassifying the patient\u2019s status and includes a specific code for the fluoroscopic diaphragmatic exam. The Sutherland system erroneously applies a transplant status code (Z942) where it is not yet applicable and omits the direct procedure coding. This discrepancy is clinically significant as it impacts both billing accuracy and the reflection of the patient\u2019s work\u2010up for lung transplant evaluation. Recommendations include re\u2010reviewing the indications for transplant status coding and aligning on the appropriate preoperative evaluation code, while ensuring that the performed diagnostic procedure is captured consistently."
